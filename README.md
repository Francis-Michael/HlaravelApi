# HlaravelApi
Android Part
just as discussed with you on the phone, the volley impllementation part using JSON doesn't display the required message from the Laravel api.
It only gives error 404 with a url of the reuired message to be displayed.
Also I have realized that the as the "Onclick event from the android doesn't change the message anytime a text field is fiiled.
Kindly help me resolve this issues.
